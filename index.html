      <figcaption id="img-caption">A pivotal figure in Malaysia, Hong Kong, mainland China and beyond, Robert Kuok has
        built a formidable family business empire</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p id="tribute-info">Malaysia’s richest man for the past couple of decades, Robert Kuok founded and controls the
      Kuok Group, which has operations across the region, in sectors including hospitality, agriculture, real estate,
      and freight and logistics. Kuok’s biggest source of wealth is his stake in Wilmar International, the world’s
      largest listed palm-oil refiner, though perhaps the Kuok Group’s best-known asset is Shangri-La Hotels.<br><br>

      Founded in Johor Bahru, Malaysia in 1949, the company was first known as Kuok Brothers, trading rice, sugar and
      wheat flour. He famously once controlled 10 per cent of the world’s sugar market, which earned him the nickname
      “the Sugar King of Asia”.<br><br>

      Kuok established a base in Singapore in 1953, where he opened the first Shangri-La Hotel in 1971. In 1974, the
      company’s Hong Kong office was founded as Kerry Holdings, opening the Kowloon Shangri-La in 1977. The Kerry Group
      also became one of the first foreign companies to establish operations in Mainland China, in 1980.<br><br>

      Also an influential political figure, with close relationships with the governments of both Malaysia and China,
      Kuok has also been focused on education and fighting poverty since 1970 through the Kuok Foundation. Through his
      foundation, he has provided scholarships and grants, donated to the improvement of educational facilities and
      promoted scientific research. He has also established countless non-profit hospitals, rehabilitation centres and
      shelters.</p>
